By apprenticeship programme we mean the apprentices that are being trained for the employer that has chosen you. The volume of training and/or on- programme assessment that you directly deliver for each employer must have some substance and must not be a token amount to satisfy this rule. It must not be limited to a brief input at the start of each employer’s programme or involve delivery to just a few of a large number of apprentices. You can find further information in the document <a class='govuk-link' href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-subcontracting'>Using Subcontractors in the Delivery of Apprenticeships</a>."
