LEPs decide how to invest the ESF for 2014 to 2020 and we support them to deliver their ESIF strategies that meet the local needs identified.<br><br>As a CFO, we must match ESF funds contracted with money from the UK government (that is, eligible mainstream programme funds). We must use some of the funding we get from the government to pay for an amount of training and support that is equivalent to the ESF contract. We identify activity that improves the skills of the workforce and helps people who have difficulties finding work. We must report this match funding and the associated learners within our funding claims to the ESF Managing Authority in England.<br><br>When we identify provision we will use as match funding, the learning activity and its associated funding become part of the ESF programme, which means that the same rules apply as those of the ESF programme."
